ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @AlyssaMaeBaruc. Based in Barcelona!

A little about me:
My background in tourism and marketing sparked a fascination with experience design and audience insights. This curiosity led me to upskill in full stack development with Codeop. I have always been eager to channel my creativity and to transform ideas into reality-something that could be made possible in this field. 

ðŸŒ± I am a continuous learner, dedicated to growth and thrilled by the different opportunities to develop my skills. Thereâ€™s so much more to learn, and thatâ€™s what excites me about this journey! Currently, Iâ€™m diving deeper into React and working on building my own portfolio.

ðŸ“« How to reach me:
Feel free to connect with me on my email: alyssabaruc16@gmail.com or on Linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/alyssamaebaruc/. I would be more than glad :)

âš¡ Fun fact: When Iâ€™m not coding, you might find me in the kitchen experimenting with new recipes or baking. I also enjoy painting, reading a good book, travelling or being outside having picnicâ€”activities.
